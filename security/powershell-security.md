We have a powershell script installed on user's local machine which is pdfprint-wrapper.ps1. This script is a wrapper to invoke pdfprint.exe with some parameters parsed from a custom protocol. The custom protocol is registered in the registry to invoke pdfprint-wrapper.ps1 when the protocol is called. The custom protocol is `pdfprint://` and the script is invoked with the following command:
```powershell
powershell -File "C:\path\to\pdfprint-wrapper.ps1" %1
```

A typical usage of the custom protocol is in format below:

```url
pdfprint://print?printer=printer_name&file=C:\path\to\file.pdf
```

The script will parse the parameters and invoke pdfprint.exe with the parameters. The script is as below:

```powershell
#!/usr/bin/env pwsh

param(
    [string]$url
)

# Check if the current session is in Constrained Language Mode
if ($ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode -ne "ConstrainedLanguage") {
    # set the property to ConstrainedLanguage
    $ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode = "ConstrainedLanguage"
} else {
    Write-Host "ConstrainedLanguage Mode is already set"
}

# Function to decode URI-encoded string
function Decode-Uri {
    param(
        [string]$encodedUri
    )
    # since contrained language mode does not support [System.Web.HttpUtility]::UrlDecode
    # we have to use the following method to decode the URI-encoded string via replacing characters manually
    $decodedUri = $encodedUri -replace '%20', ' ' -replace '%21', '!' -replace '%22', '"' -replace '%23', '#' -replace '%24', '$' -replace '%25', '%' -replace '%26', '&' -replace '%27', "'" -replace '%28', '(' -replace '%29', ')' -replace '%2A', '*' -replace '%2B', '+' -replace '%2C', ',' -replace '%2D', '-' -replace '%2E', '.' -replace '%2F', '/' -replace '%3A', ':' -replace '%3B', ';' -replace '%3C', '<' -replace '%3D', '=' -replace '%3E', '>' -replace '%3F', '?' -replace '%40', '@' -replace '%5B', '[' -replace '%5C', '\' -replace '%5D', ']' -replace '%5E', '^' -replace '%5F', '_' -replace '%60', '`' -replace '%7B', '{' -replace '%7C', '|' -replace '%7D', '}' -replace '%7E', '~'
    return $decodedUri
}

# Check if the URL parameter is not provided
if (-not $url) {
    Write-Host "No URL parameter provided"
    exit
}

# Parse the URL parameter
$uri = [uri]::new($url)

# Extract query parameters manually
$queryParams = @{}
$uri.Query.TrimStart('?').Split('&') | ForEach-Object {
    $key, $value = $_.Split('=')
    $queryParams[$key] = Decode-Uri -encodedUri $value
}

$printer = $queryParams['printer']
$file = $queryParams['file']

# Display the constructed command and execute it
$command = "pdfprint.exe -printer `"$printer`" `"$file`""
Write-Host "Executing command: $command"
Invoke-Expression $command

# Write an Event Log
$eventLogMessage = "Printed file $file to printer $printer"
Write-EventLog -LogName "Windows PowerShell" -Source "PowerShell" -EntryType Information -EventId 1000 -Message $eventLogMessage
```

Now we will need to consider the security to use this custom protocol. The custom protocol is registered in the registry and can be invoked by any application. This is a potential security risk as any application can invoke the custom protocol and execute the script. We need to consider the following security measures:

| Item                     | Description                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Validation               | Validate the parameters passed in the custom protocol to ensure they are safe and expected.                 |
| Restricted Language Mode | Run the script in a restricted language mode to prevent malicious code execution.                           |
| Event Logging            | Log the execution of the script to track the usage of the custom protocol.                                  |
| Registry Permissions     | Set appropriate permissions on the registry key to restrict access to the custom protocol.                  |
| User Permissions         | Ensure that the user has the necessary permissions to execute the script and access the required resources. |
| Authentication           | Restrict access to the custom protocol based on user authentication or authorization.                       |
| Encryption               | Encrypt the parameters passed in the custom protocol to prevent tampering or eavesdropping.                 |

## Implementation

### Validation

Validate the parameters passed in the custom protocol to ensure they are safe and expected. For example, check if the printer name is valid and the file path is accessible.

- The printer name should be validated against a list of allowed printers to prevent arbitrary printer selection.

- The file path can be a local file path or a share folder path. If it is a share folder path, ensure that the user has the necessary permissions to access the share folder.

### Restricted Language Mode

- Run the script in a restricted language mode to prevent malicious code execution. Constrained Language Mode restricts access to sensitive APIs and prevents the execution of arbitrary code.

- Set the `$ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode` to `"ConstrainedLanguage"` at the beginning of the script to enforce the restricted language mode.

### Event Logging

- Log the execution of the script to track the usage of the custom protocol. Use the `Write-EventLog` cmdlet to write an event log entry with information about the executed command.

- Include details such as the printed file, printer name, and timestamp in the event log message.

### Registry Permissions

- Set appropriate permissions on the registry key that registers the custom protocol to restrict access to the custom protocol. Only allow trusted applications or users to invoke the custom protocol.

   For example, I want to only allow Edge browser to invoke the custom protocol, I can set the permissions as below:

   The create-pdfprint-protocol.reg file content is as below:

   ```reg
    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

    [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\pdfprint]
    @="URL:pdfprint Protocol"
    "URL Protocol"=""

    [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\pdfprint\DefaultIcon]
    @="\"C:\\path\\to\\pdfprint-wrapper.ps1\""

    [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\pdfprint\shell]

    [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\pdfprint\shell\open]

    [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\pdfprint\shell\open\command]
    @="\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\" -File \"C:\\path\\to\\pdfprint-wrapper.ps1\" \"%1\""
    ```

    The permissions can be set as below:

    ```powershell
    $acl = Get-Acl -Path "HKCR:\pdfprint"
    $rule = New-Object System.Security.AccessControl.RegistryAccessRule ("Edge Browser", "ReadKey", "Allow")
    $acl.SetAccessRule($rule)
    Set-Acl -Path "HKCR:\pdfprint" -AclObject $acl
    ```

### User Permissions

- Ensure that the user has the necessary permissions to execute the script and access the required resources. The user should have permission to run PowerShell scripts and access the printer and file specified in the custom protocol.

  - Since this is a custom protocol, how to ensure the user has the necessary permissions to execute the script and access the required resources?

  A possible way is to check the user's permissions before executing the script. For example, check if the user has the necessary permissions to access the printer and file specified in the custom protocol.

  ```powershell
    # Check if the user has permission to access the printer
    $printer = $queryParams['printer']
    $printerSecurity = Get-Printer -Name $printer | Get-PrinterSecurity
    if ($printerSecurity -eq $null) {
        Write-Host "User does not have permission to access printer $printer"
        exit
    }
  ```

### Authentication

- Restrict access to the custom protocol based on user authentication or authorization. Only authenticated and authorized users should be allowed to invoke the custom protocol.
- Implement user authentication mechanisms such as OAuth, JWT, or Kerberos to verify the identity of the user invoking the custom protocol.
- Use role-based access control (RBAC) to define which users or applications are allowed to invoke the custom protocol.
- For example, only users in the "Print Operators" group are allowed to invoke the custom protocol.
- Implement a login mechanism to authenticate users before allowing them to use the custom protocol.
- Use Windows authentication to verify the identity of the user invoking the custom protocol.
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security to the authentication process.
- Use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to manage user identities and control access to the custom protocol.
- Implement IP whitelisting to restrict access to the custom protocol based on the user's IP address.
- Use client certificates to authenticate users before allowing them to invoke the custom protocol.
- Implement single sign-on (SSO) to allow users to access the custom protocol using their existing credentials.
- Use Azure Key Vault to securely store and manage authentication keys and secrets used by the custom protocol.

How to implement authentication for the custom protocol?

Since we are in a powershell script, how to implement authentication? One possible way is to prompt the user for authentication before executing the script. For example, use the `Get-Credential` cmdlet to prompt the user for their credentials and verify the credentials before allowing the script to continue.

Some application such as vscode plugin can prompt the user for login to the company's SSO system before invoking the custom protocol. How to implement this in the powershell script?

```powershell
# Prompt the user for authentication
$credential = Get-Credential -Message "Enter your credentials"

```
